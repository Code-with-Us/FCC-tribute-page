# FCC-tribute-page 

This is a collaboration project with Code-with-Us group, to assit, encourage, and create something awesome together. 

We will be working on the new FCC site, and assist with finding bugs in their new curriculmn. 

Here is all the information for the new site

## Help us build Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp curriculum Contributors

 
# Quincy Larson

**Hey freeCodeCamp contributors** - soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges, you’ll learn through building projects - step by step.

Before I get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.

*A brief history of the curriculum*

OK - Version 7.0! Here’s a history of our curriculum versions to give you some more context:

*V1 - 2014: I launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard’s CS50 and Stanford’s Database Class.

*V2 - 2015: We added interactive algorithm challenges.

*V3 - 2015: We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we’d been relying on General Assembly’s Dash course for these).

*V4 - 2016: We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.

*V5 - 2017: We added the back end and data visualization challenges.

*V6 - 2018: We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.

### Why we need a Version 7.0
Throughout freeCodeCamp’s history, I’ve heard the same two requests almost every day:

Please smooth out the difficulty of freeCodeCamp’s curriculum. It holds your hand for the challenges, then abruptly stops holding your hand during the projects.

Please add more repetition to the curriculum so people can better-retain what they’re learning.

Well, after years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor!

It wasn’t as dramatic as Doc’s revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects.

Instead of individual coding challenges, we’ll just have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn’t enough.)

No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build up a working project.

Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own understanding of coding fundamentals.

There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into projects.

And there’s plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.

New and improved tests\
The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text.

Old test description text: Your h1 element should have the text “Hello World”.

New test description text: HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>. Find the h1 element and change the text between its opening and closing tags to say “Hello World”.

Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from “reading mode” to “coding mode”.

Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They’ll get that sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

An Overview of the Version 7.0 Curriculum
Each topic will be taught through building a project. Each section within each certification will have a name that follows this pattern: “Learn _______ by building a _______.”

For example, the original HTML curriculum becomes: “Learn HTML by building a cat photo app.”

**To this end, I’ve modified our curriculum to make each section project-oriented.

***I hope these rough ideas help you visualize what our curriculum could be like.***

# How You Can Help Us Build This
We’ve already started designing these projects.   For example, here’s what we the “Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game” project looks like:


Here’s @beaucarnes’s CodePen implementation if you’re curious: https://codepen.io/beaucarnes/pen/BbLWpe 51

People will learn JavaScript by building up this game one test at a time.

Here’s what the tests for the “Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App” currently look like:

feat: Updated HTML curriculum - draft

1 commits changed 58 files with 1698 additions and 0 deletions.
It will take several months to build all these projects, their associated tests, and to QA everything. Our plan is to roll these new projects out to the curriculum as we finish them.

And that’s where you, kind person who have read this far, come in.

The last time we updated the curriculum, we had dozens of amazing contributors who helped with the process, 
and we are optimistic that together, we can build these projects even more quickly.

# We need help with the following:

1. Building the initial projects
2. Taking these projects and working backward, disassembling them into a series of dozens (hundreds?) of concise test descriptions
3. Once we have the test descriptions, we need to implement the tests themselves

***I’ve created a GitHub Project we can all use to track the overall progress of Version 7.0 of the curriculum here: https://github.com/orgs/freeCodeCamp/projects/10 77***

# If you’re serious about contributing, here’s what I recommend you do:

Leave a comment below, introducing yourself and sharing your thoughts on all this
Join the freeCodeCamp Contributor Chatroom if you haven’t already: https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/contributors 30

Comment on the GitHub issues of the projects you are interested in helping with. Even the most general of ideas or prototypes will help us kick off this process. The issues for these are all located on our Curriculum Expansion repository: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues 36

With your help, the millions of people who are learning to code through freeCodeCamp will have an even better resource to help them learn these fundamentals, and gain the confidence to build more ambitious projects.
